# VBA-Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The intent of this project was to refactor (restructure (the source code of an application or piece of software) so as to improve operation without altering functionality) the original stock analysis code to see if I could obtain faster run times and allow for diversification of data sets.

## Analysis



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered



## Results

![VBA Challenge 2017 Data](Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017_Data.png) ![2017 Original](Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017_Original.png) ![2017 Refactored](Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png)

The first picture shown above is the data output after running the refactored macro, it was made to match the original macro. The second picture shows the original codes time output for year 2017. The third picture shows the refactored time output for year 2017. As one can see, the refactored code's time output for year 2017 was 0.1953125 seconds (73.52%) faster than the original code's time output for year 2017.

![VBA Challenge 2018 Data](Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018_Data.png) ![2018 Original](Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018_Original1.png) ![2018 Refactored](Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)

The first picture shown above is the data output after running the refactored macro, it was made to match the original macro. The second picture shows the original codes time output for year 2018. The third picture shows the refactored time output for year 2018. As one can see, the refactored code's time output for year 2018 was 0.203125 seconds (76.47%) faster than the original code's time output for year 2018. 

Since the refactored code's time outputs were both significantly faster than the original codes, it is inferred that the refactored code is more efficient than the original code. 

Since the refactored code includes arrays instead of hardcoding rows/columns like the original code does, it is inferred that the refactored code allows for more diversity among data sets. That is, the code is not limiting the data set.

Nick Foley helped me when I got stuck on portions of this project.
